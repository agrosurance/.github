<h4 style="text-align:center;" align="center">Surity is an innovative insurance platform empowering marketers to craft bespoke policies with transparent premium calculation and streamlined claim validation, fostering trust and confidence in policy transactions.</h4>



## Inspiration

🌾Experience in Agriculture Insurance: Leveraged insights and lessons from developing Agrosurance, a web3 project focused on agriculture insurance, to inform the creation of Surity.

🚜 Recognition of Industry Challenges: Acknowledged the challenges faced by farmers and insurers, including issues of accessibility, transparency, and trust within the insurance industry.

💡 Innovation in Insurance Solutions: Inspired by the potential of web3 technologies, sought to disrupt traditional insurance models by introducing novel solutions for policy creation and management, with a focus on empowering both insurance providers and policyholders.

🌐 Empowerment through Technology: Embraced the potential of technology to democratize the insurance market, putting power into the hands of users and fostering a community built on fairness, transparency, and trust.

## What it does

### User-Centric Functionality

1. The platform serves two primary user roles: insurance providers and policyholders. Insurance providers offer various insurance policies, while policyholders purchase and benefit from these policies.

2. Users have the option to stake in different insurance policies using a unique staking mechanism. For every USD contributed, users receive 1 platform token. They can withdraw their USD at any time.

3. Monthly, a fixed amount of “surity tokens” is released to reward participants. 10% of these tokens are retained by the platform, to make profit and no tokens from the stakes / insurees would be taken as a fee, while the remaining tokens are distributed among stakeholders according to their stake ratios.

4. Out of the initial supply, in the first month we will release 20% of the total supply then every consecutive month, we will decrease the released coins by 20% so it will go like, 20%, then 16%, 12.8% and so on…

5. Marketers play a pivotal role by creating new insurance policies and providing transparent functions for premium calculation and claim validation. These functions are accessible to users, ensuring transparency and trust in the insurance process. Policy providers can also stake in other policies.

### Customized Staking Mechanism and Policy Visibility

1. A custom form empowers users to specify conditions to stake in other tokens like Sol, Link, Eth, Trx. These conditions include triggers such as deposit into the pool through premium, deposit through staking, time duration, or general deposit into the pool.

2. Additional conditions, such as specific amounts or ranges of received deposits, are configurable. Users can also specify the percentage of money to be staked and the target destination for their stake.

3. Each insurance policy page provides visibility into the allocation of pooled funds and details of customized automated investments. Users can track how their stake is utilized and the automated investment strategy implemented for each policy.

### Application and Developers Section [WIP]

1. Developers have access to a comprehensive API that exposes Surity's functionalities, including policy creation, premium calculation, claim validation, stake management, and more.

2. The API documentation will provide a detailed instructions on how to interact with each endpoint, along with sample requests and responses, enabling developers to seamlessly integrate Surity's features into their applications.

3. With access to the API, developers can build their own websites or applications with a customized interface that showcases their policies and brand identity.

4. Developers have the flexibility to design and implement user interfaces tailored to their specific requirements, offering a unique and immersive experience for their users.

5. All of the Applications which utilizes the Surity API would be visible to the consumer of Surity on the Application section so that they can easily access it from there.

## Project Value:
🪟 Transparency: Blockchain technology ensures transparency by providing a decentralized ledger where all transactions and activities related to policy creation, premium calculation, claim validation, and fund utilization are recorded. This transparency instills trust among users as they can verify how policy marketers are investing funds, validating claims, and generating premium costs without relying on a centralized source.

💰Liquidity: Blockchain enables the creation of unique incentives for individuals willing to maintain liquidity for policy marketers. Through a staking system, users can stake tokens for their chosen policies, providing liquidity to the platform. Policy marketers can also choose where to invest the received funds, and this process can be automated using blockchain technology. This liquidity mechanism enhances the accessibility and efficiency of the insurance marketplace.

💸Rewards: Blockchain platforms inherently offer mechanisms for rewarding users. In our platform, users who stake tokens, regardless of the policy they choose, will be rewarded with SureCoins, our platform’s native tokens. These rewards are generated from the total initial token supply and are proportionately distributed based on the staking amount. To maintain token value and incentivize participation, tokens will be released monthly, with the percentage of the initial supply decreasing by 20% each month.

👩‍💻Secure Function Execution: While function definitions are public, the actual execution occurs in a secure and private server environment managed by us. User details, provided as function arguments, are not stored on the blockchain. Instead, a server executes the functions, signs the outputs, and our smart contract verifies the authenticity of the execution log before accepting premiums. This approach ensures data privacy and security while maintaining the benefits of transparency and decentralization.

## Benefits of Blockchain and Decentralization:

🤝Trust and Reliability: Blockchain’s decentralized nature eliminates the need for a central authority, ensuring trust and reliability in the insurance marketplace. Users can confidently engage with the platform knowing that their transactions and interactions are transparent, immutable, and resistant to tampering or manipulation.

🔐Security: Blockchain technology employs robust cryptographic techniques to secure data and transactions. This enhances the security of sensitive information such as personal details, policy terms, and financial transactions, reducing the risk of fraud or data breaches.

💪Efficiency and Automation: Smart contracts, a key feature of blockchain technology, enable the automation of various processes such as premium calculation, claim validation, and rewards distribution. This streamlines operations, reduces administrative overhead, and ensures timely and accurate execution of contractual agreements.

🤑Incentives and Rewards: By leveraging blockchain’s tokenization capabilities, our platform can incentivize user participation and engagement through rewards and token-based incentives. This fosters a vibrant and active community while aligning the interests of stakeholders towards the platform’s success.

## What's next for Surity

⌛Integrate the functionality which is already being developed on the smart contract with the frontend and backend

🧑‍💻Add functionality of Automated Investment of policy pool money in different tokens and integrate it with its already developed frontend. Make Surity fully functioning to support and work as an Telegram mini app

🧑‍💻Implement Application and developer features within the Surity platform, enabling Developers to utilize the functionalities of Surity through APIs into their own applications. They can create their own websites which would list only their own policies. All these applications would be listed in the Application section to let consumers of Surity know about them.
